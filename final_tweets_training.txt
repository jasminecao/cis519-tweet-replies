negative	Beto (Real Name Robert) says, “rich people are going to have to allow or be forced to allow-lower-income people to live near them.” Um, no. Living by your work is NOT a right. I think you’re confused, buddy. What is a right? The Second Amendment-which you and your ilk crap on.
negative	This is purely unacceptable! Adults, PLEASE PLEASE see and speak up for kids, people, and all humans who are at the receiving end of this ignorance. Breaks my heart. https://t.co/uiiwujBDDZ
neutral	So let’s state it again. I’m pro medicine. I’m pro science. I’ve never told anyone not to take medicine. I’ve never fat-shamed anyone. And today there’s a new one: no I don’t support Scientology. The machinery of mischaracterization is in high gear now. Gee, did I upset someone?
negative	Here we go again. More nonsense from VAR. Pukki goal ruled out when level. If you have to draw lines and dots and it’s still not clear one way or the other, then please stop undermining the on-field officials. Absurd.
negative	In 85 days, ~1 million people have fled their homes in #Idlib, #Syria. 60% are kids &amp; 20% women. They're now homeless, hemmed onto a shut #Turkey border.

neutral	I just realized why people are so frustrated in the Trump era. It’s not just the obvious ignorance, selfishness, fear &amp; hatred of Trump - it’s that the media won’t fully acknowledge it. It’s gaslighting the whole country as if it’s something to be debated.
negative	Three quarters of American voters know a trial without witnesses is nothing more than a cover-up. More than half know Trump is lying (again). Why can't @SenateGOP represent America instead of representing @realDonaldTrump? https://t.co/iT1dwn5oqB
